// CP - Rewrite the Sample Program 2 with user inputs
// Hint =>
// 1. Create variables and take user inputs for name, fromCity, viaCity, toCity
// 2. Create variables and take user inputs for distances fromToVia and viaToFinalCity in Miles
// 3. Create Variables and take user input for the time taken: From City to Via City and Via City to Final
// Destination
// 4. Finally, print the result and try to understand operator precedence.
// I/P => name, fromCity, viaCity, toCity, fromToVia, viaToFinalCity, timeFromToVia, timeViaToFinalCity
// O/P => The Total Distance travelled by ___ from ___ to ___ via ___ is ___ km and the Total Time taken
// is ___ minutes
